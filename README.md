# Competitive Programming

This repositorie contains solutions of algoritmic problems from contests held on [Code Chef](https://www.codechef.com) [Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam/), that were solved by me during the contest or after the contest. Most of my solutions are written in python.

>**Note**: The solution to the problems in this repositorie might not be the most optimal one and the solutions are uploaded after the end of contests.
